# Multi - Domain Enterprise Digital Assistant

In this developer journey we will create a Watson Conversation, NLU & RnR based chatbot for multiple domains.
that provides users with:

* Answers important FAQs queries from the multiple domains such as across business lines of Loans, Account Opening, Market Place & Digital Banking of Banking industry.
* Also the chatbot solves transactional queries such as view transactions, balances, pay utility bills etc.

When the reader has completed this journey, they will understand how to:

* Create a chatbot with dialogs using Watson Conversation on NodeJS platform
* Learn how to best create Retrieve n Rank collection for long tail questions.
* Get enhanced natural language capability through NLU API
* Understand the Banking domain for creating a chatbot & using Conversation and Retrieve n Rank in sync.


## Technical Architecture - Enterprise Digital Assistant

![](doc/source/images/Banking-Architecture.png)


## Flow

* The user writes a query about a service to the chatbot
* The orchestrator accepts query, saves the user context & starts a REST call with the Cognitive APIs.
* Depending on the nature of the query (long /Short tail), the answer is provided by either Watson Conversation API or Watson Retrieve and Rank
* Further to answering user queries, the agent can also be connected to Third party APIs such as India Stack(Aadhaar) for authentication required for verifying identify, e-sign, purchases etc. ;language translation APIs for localization.
* Orchestrator can be further exposed to enterprise systems such as CRM, warehouses, ERP etc. for contextual content.

## Features
* State & Context Management
* Large Information retrieval
* Personal Information Protection
* Recommendation Engine
* Enhanced Natural Language Understanding
* Enterprise Integration

## Included Components
* Bluemix Watson Conversation
* Bluemix Watson Retrieve n Rank
* Bluemix Watson Tone Analyzer
* Bluemix Watson Natural Language Understanding
* Node JS Runtime

## Deploy the App

NOTE: Perform steps 1-6 OR click the Deploy to Bluemix button to do it all at once!

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/ibm/watson-banking-chatbot)

1. Log in to your Bluemix account before deploying.
If already logged in, then ignore this step.
![](doc/source/images/Login-bluemix.png)

2. We can see that the app is ready to be deplyed, and we need to ensure that the App name, region, Organization, Space is valid before 'Deploy'.
![](doc/source/images/deploy-click.png)

3. In Toolchain, the app is deployed. There are also option to edit code via eclipseIDE, git changes if required.
Once deployed, the app can be viewed by clicking 'View app'.
![](doc/source/images/toolchain-pipeline.png)

4. Wait for the deployment to complete, the following actions will be performed:

  * Creates the application.
  * Creates a Conversation and Retrieve & Rank service instance.

5.
It is required to configure the Conversation and R-n-R service that is created. We can follow the next steps


6. Configure Watson Conversation

Launch the **Watson Conversation** tool. Use the **import** icon button on the right

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" height="55" src="doc/source/images/import_conversation_workspace.png">
</p>

Find the local version of [`data/WCS/workspace-ConversationalBanking.json`](data/WCS/workspace-ConversationalBanking.json) and select
**Import**. Find the **Workspace ID** by clicking on the context menu of the new
workspace and select **View details**.
###### Save this ID for later.

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" height="250" src="doc/source/images/open_conversation_menu.png">
</p>

*Optionally*, to view the conversation dialog select the workspace and choose the
**Dialog** tab, here's a snippet of the dialog:

![](doc/source/images/dialog.PNG)

7. Configure Watson Retrieve and Rank

Launch the **Watson retrieve-and-rank** tool. Create a **new data cluster**.

###### Save this CLUSTER_ID for later.

![](doc/source/images/rnr-cluster.PNG)

Seed the content by firstly creating **New Collection**, and add the file documents and questions present under [`data/Retrieve&Rank/`](data/Retrieve&Rank/)

![](doc/source/images/new-collection.PNG)

###### Save this COLLECTION_NAME for later.

> Note: Ensure that you have also created a [**Watson Document Conversion**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/document-conversion) service as well. Since, Watson RnR uses document conversion at the backend.

8. Once the watson services are configured, Go to View App -> Runtime -> Environment Variables -> User Defined, add the IDs saved above and save it.

![](doc/source/images/runtime-settings.png)

The application and services have been successfully deployed, and you are now ready to use the application.

# Steps

1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Create Watson services on IBM Bluemix](#2-create-watson-services-on-ibm-bluemix)
3. [Configure Watson Conversation](#3-configure-watson-conversation)
4. [Configure Watson Retrieve and Rank](#4-configure-watson-retrieve-and-rank)
5. [Run the application](#5-run-the-application)

## 1. Clone the repo

Clone the `ConversationalBanking` locally. In a terminal, run:

`$ git clone https://github.ibm.com/IBMDigital/ConversationalBanking`

Weâ€™ll be using the file [`data/WCS/workspace-ConversationalBanking.json`](data/WCS/workspace-ConversationalBanking.json) and the folder
[`data/WCS/`](data/WCS/)

## 2. Create Watson services on IBM Bluemix

Create the following services:

* [**Watson Conversation**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/conversation)
* [**Watson Retrieve n Rank**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/retrieve-and-rank)
* [**Watson Tone Analyzer**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/tone-analyzer)
* [**Watson Natural language understanding**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/natural-language-understanding)

> Note: Ensure that you have logged into Bluemix and are allowed to use these services.

## 3. Configure Watson Conversation

Launch the **Watson Conversation** tool. Use the **import** icon button on the right

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" height="55" src="doc/source/images/import_conversation_workspace.png">
</p>

Find the local version of [`data/WCS/workspace-ConversationalBanking.json`](data/WCS/workspace-ConversationalBanking.json) and select
**Import**. Find the **Workspace ID** by clicking on the context menu of the new
workspace and select **View details**. Save this ID for later.

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" height="250" src="doc/source/images/open_conversation_menu.png">
</p>

*Optionally*, to view the conversation dialog select the workspace and choose the
**Dialog** tab, here's a snippet of the dialog:

![](doc/source/images/dialog.PNG)

## 4. Configure Watson Retrieve and Rank

Launch the **Watson retrieve-and-rank** tool. Create a **new data cluster**.

![](doc/source/images/rnr-cluster.PNG)

Seed the content by firstly creating **New Collection**, and add the file documents and questions present under [`data/Retrieve&Rank/`](data/Retrieve&Rank/)

![](doc/source/images/new-collection.PNG)

> Note: Ensure that you have also created a [**Watson Document Conversion**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/document-conversion) service as well. Since, Watson RnR uses document conversion at the backend.

## 5. Run the application

### If you used the Deploy to Bluemix button...

If you used ``Deploy to Bluemix``, most of the setup is automatic to start using the App.

### If you want to run it locally...

Otherwise as explained above:
1. Clone the repo
2. Instantiate/ Configure the above watson services
2. Install NodeJS runtime or npm.
3. Start the app and it can be used at localhost:3000

> Note: server host can be changed as required in server.js


# Troubleshooting tips

If you are using the IBM Jazz DevOps to deploy the app, you may see the following steps as required to deploy:

1. *Optional:* If you are asked to choose an alias, enter a unique alias name and click create.
![](doc/source/images/alias.PNG)

2. *Optional:* If you are asked to choose an alias, verify your alias name and click continue.
